# How to use
> ## STEP 1
+ Start VRChat
+ Switch into any avatar of your choosing
+ Wait for the avatar to load **FULLY**
+ Open the "AvatarLockpick.exe"
+ Input **YOUR** VRChat User ID, then input the **AVATAR** ID
> ## STEP 2
+ Unlock the avatar via the normal unlock method **OR** if it has custom locks or VRCF locks use the "Unlock (VRCFURY)" option (Not sure how well this works, I'll update to suite and look into avatar lock systems more)
+ After that enjoy the public avatar

> ### Notes
+ Yes you can use this to unlock your private avatars if you have forgotten the password
+ Should work no matter if it's private or public
