# How to use
> ## STEP 1
+ Start VRChat
+ Switch into any avatar of your choosing
+ Wait for the avatar to load **FULLY** (then wait a bit incase it is not cached)
+ Open the AvatarLockpick application
+ Input **YOUR** VRChat User ID, then input the **AVATAR's** ID
> ## STEP 2
+ Unlock the avatar via the normal unlock method **OR** if it has custom locks or VRCF locks use the "Unlock (VRCFURY)" or "Unlock using Database"
+ After that restart your game and enjoy the unlocked avatar
⚠️ **IMPORTANT** You **NEED** to restart as VRChat loads the avatar's save data / config data at game launch

> ### Notes
+ Yes you can use this to unlock your private avatars if you have forgotten the password
+ Should work no matter if it's private or public
