# AvatarLockpick
Ever wanted to use a VRChat avatar but it was locked? Well now you can unlock it using AvatarLockpick!

## What's this all about?
AvatarLockpick is user friendly tool for unlocking VRChat avatars. It works by scanning through your VRChat cache and helps you access avatars that would otherwise be locked away. Pretty neat, right?

## ⚠️ Important Note
> **This tool is NOT associated with VRChat Inc. in any way.**
> 
> AvatarLockpick is completely safe to use as it:
> - Only scans your local VRChat cache files
> - Never modifies the game or its processes
> - Runs entirely as an external application
> - Does not interact with VRChat's runtime
> 
> Using this tool will NOT result in a ban as it operates within VRChat's Terms of Service by only reading locally cached files.
>
> Also beware that some avatars have locks that are scrambled or hidden so some avatars may not unlock fully. (I will try my best to figure out ways to still unlock these avatars)
